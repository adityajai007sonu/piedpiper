There is the following math brain teaser on it (besides others). 100 measures of corn must be divided among 5 workers, so that the second worker gets as many measures more than the first worker, as the third gets more than the second, the fourth more than the third and the fifth more than the fourth.

So this is the solution: 1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn, 2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn, 3rd worker = 120/6 (20) measures of corn, 4th worker = 175/6 measures of corn, 5th worker = 230/6 measures of corn ",

The kingdom of Mamajorca, was ruled by queen Henrietta I. In Mamajorca women have to pass an extensive logic exam before they are allowed to get married. Queens do not have to take this exam. All the women in Mamajorca are loyal to their queen and do whatever she tells them to. The queens of Mamajorca are truthful. All shots fired in Mamajorca can be heard in every house. All above facts are known to be common knowledge. Henrietta was worried about the infidelity of the married men in Mamajorca. She summoned all the wives to the town square, and made the following announcement. `There is at least one unfaithful husband in Mamajorca. All wives know which husbands are unfaithful, but have no knowledge about the fidelity of their own husband. You are forbidden to discuss your husband's faithfulness with any other woman. If you discover that your husband is unfaithful, you must shoot him at precisely midnight of the day you find that out.` Thirty-nine silent nights followed the queen's announcement. On the fortieth night, shots were heard. Queen Henrietta I is revered in Mamajorcan history.",
	"mobile": 9929217947,
	"address": "The two questions for scroll #1 were: 1. How many husbands were shot on that fateful night? 2. Why is Queen Henrietta I revered in Mamajorca? The answers are: If there are n unfaithful husbands (UHs), every wife of an UH knows of n-1 UH's while every wife of a faithful husband knows of n UHs. [this because everyone has perfect information about everything except the fidelity of their own husband]. Now we do a simple induction: Assume that there is only one UH. Then all the wives but one know that there is just one UH, but the wife of the UH thinks that everyone is faithful. Upon hearing that `there is at least one UH`, the wife realizes that the only husband it can be is her own, and so shoots him. Now, imagine that there are just two UH's. Each wife of an UH assumes that the situation is `only one UH in town` and so waits to hear the other wife (she knows who it is, of course) shoot her husband on the first night. When no one is shot, that can only be because her OWN husband was a second UH. The wife of the second UH makes the same deduction when no shot is fired the first night (she was waiting, and expecting the other to shoot, too). So they both figure it out after the first night, and shoot their husbands the second night. It is easy to tidy up the induction to show that the n UHs will all be shot just on the n'th midnight. ",
